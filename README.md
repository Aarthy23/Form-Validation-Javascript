# 📋 JavaScript Mini Project – **Form Validation**

This project focuses on building a **User Registration Form** with custom **form validation** using **JavaScript**. It strengthened my skills in using the **DOM (Document Object Model)** to read, manipulate, and validate user input dynamically before form submission.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 (Form structure)
- CSS3 (Basic styling)
- JavaScript (Validation & DOM Manipulation)

---

## ✨ Features

- User-friendly registration form  
- Input validation for:
  - ✅ Name (required)
  - ✅ Email (must include character, number & '@' symbol)
  - ✅ Password and Confirm Password (required & match check)
  - ✅ Zip Code (6+ digits only)
  - ✅ State selection (dropdown must be selected)
- JavaScript alerts for missing or invalid fields  
- DOM interactions using `getElementById()` and `formName.inputName.focus()`  
- Regex used for email and zip code validation  

---

## 📚 Key Concepts Learned

- ✅ **DOM Manipulation** for accessing and updating form elements  
- ✅ Writing conditional validation logic  
- ✅ Creating and using **Regular Expressions (RegEx)** for pattern matching  
- ✅ Preventing form submission using `return false` when validation fails  
- ✅ Validating drop-down fields and passwords dynamically  
- ✅ Using `.focus()` to bring user attention to invalid fields  

---

## 🧠 Fixes/Improvements Made

- Corrected `if(user_email = "")` to `if(user_email == "")` (comparison vs assignment)
- Improved regular expressions for better validation  
- Ensured meaningful alert messages for each field  
- Fixed usage of `document.user_form.inputName.focus()`  

---

## 💡 Goal

This project helped me practice real-world scenarios where **validating form data is crucial before submission**. I also deepened my understanding of **how JavaScript interacts with form elements via the DOM**, which is essential for front-end development.
